SQL Validation Agent

This agent validates SQL queries before execution.
Checks for logical correctness, not just syntax.

Responsibilities:
- Validate SQL logic (not just syntax)
- Check for common mistakes (self-comparisons, incorrect filters, etc.)
- Handle text-based answers (skip validation)
- Store validation result in path_state

Design Decisions:
- Uses LLM to validate logical correctness
- Sets connection data based on retrieved tables
- Returns decision: "valid_sql" or "invalid_sql"

    ``weatherandstructure`` and fail with "relation does not exist".

    The model is shown these exact names in the AVAILABLE TABLES/COLUMNS

    that's already unique per row — e.g. ``GROUP BY`` (or a window function's
    ``PARTITION BY``) on the FROM table's own primary key, or on a column
    known unique from observed-data profiling. Since such a column has
    exactly one distinct value per row, every group/partition contains
    exactly one row and any aggregate over it (``AVG``, ``SUM``, a window
    ``COUNT`` etc.) is a silent no-op — it parses and executes fine but never
    computes what "average per <thing>" actually means.

    Scoped to the narrow, always-true case only: a single-table SELECT block
    (no JOIN *within that block*) grouping/partitioning by that same table's
    own key. A JOIN can legitimately re-introduce multiple rows per key (e.g.
    aggregating a child table's rows per parent id), so this intentionally
    does not flag a block once a JOIN is present in it — that needs
    join-cardinality reasoning this check doesn't attempt.

    Checked on *every* SELECT block in the parsed tree — the outermost query,
    every subquery, every CTE — not just the outermost one. A subquery that
    itself vacuously groups a table by its own key is just as much a no-op as
    if it were written at the top level; wrapping it in an outer JOIN back to
    the same table (e.g. ``t JOIN (SELECT k, AVG(x) FROM t GROUP BY k) s ON
    t.k = s.k``) makes the *outer* query's FROM/JOIN shape look fine while
    the actual aggregation inside the subquery is still averaging exactly one
    row per group — a real pattern seen in practice once reconstruction was
    pushed away from the bare single-table form.

    Also catches the same no-op spelled without ``GROUP BY``/``PARTITION BY``
    at all: a correlated (or plain) scalar-subquery aggregate whose ``WHERE``
    filters the table down by its own unique column — e.g. ``(SELECT
    AVG(s.x) FROM t s WHERE s.pk = rp.pk)``. Filtering to an exact match on a
    unique column matches at most one row, so the aggregate is exactly as
    vacuous as ``GROUP BY`` on that column, just spelled differently — seen
    in practice as the next thing reconstruction tried once the GROUP-BY
    form got rejected.

    Off by default — see :func:`_vacuous_group_by_check_enabled`; opt-in via
    ``DETECT_VACUOUS_GROUP_BY``. Both call sites (this module's
    ``SQLValidationAgent`` and ``join_path_check.py``'s self-applied
    bridge-fix guard) already treat ``""`` as "nothing wrong", so disabling
    this check is a no-op change to their control flow.

    Returns ``""`` when nothing looks wrong, including whenever the SQL
    doesn't contain "group by"/"partition by"/an aggregate function call at
    all (checked before any parsing, so the common case costs nothing) or
    isn't parseable (left to the normal parse validator).

    but also selects a *different*, many-side-joined table's column raw,

    Mirror-image failure to :func:`detect_vacuous_group_by`: instead of an
    aggregate that's a no-op because nothing varies within a group, this is
    a column that's silently *undefined* within a group because a joined
    child table can contribute more than one row per group — e.g.
    ``GROUP BY fan.id`` while also directly selecting
    ``interactions.watch_hrs`` when a fan can have many interaction rows.
    Every SQL engine this pipeline targets (Postgres included) accepts this
    without error whenever it's spelled without an explicit ``GROUP BY`` at
    all; it's only actually an error when a ``GROUP BY`` is present and the
    ungrouped column isn't functionally dependent on it — which is exactly
    the case this checks. It parses and executes fine, silently picking an
    arbitrary row's value instead of the intended per-group summary.

    Scoped to the narrow, always-true case: a SELECT block with an explicit
    ``GROUP BY`` on a bare column, at least one ``JOIN ... ON`` in that same
    block, and a join equality where PK/unique key metadata *confirms* one
    side is the "many" side relative to the other (ambiguous cardinality is
    left unflagged — see :func:`_many_side_tables`). Does not attempt the
    much harder "no GROUP BY at all" case, where the intended output grain
    isn't recoverable from the SQL's own structure — that needs a separate
    signal this check doesn't have. Only the SELECT list is inspected, not
    ORDER BY/HAVING.
