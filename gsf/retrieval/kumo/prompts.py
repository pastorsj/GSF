# Static instructions (PQL grammar + the failure-mode guardrails). Everything
# below the header is assembled conditionally in ``build_pql_prompt``.
_PQL_HEADER = """You are an expert in Kumo's Predictive Query Language (PQL). Translate the user's predictive question
into a single PQL query that runs against the relational graph described below.

## PQL grammar
```
PREDICT <target> [RANK TOP k] FOR EACH <entity_table>.<primary_key> [WHERE <filter>] [ASSUMING <cond>]
PREDICT <target> [RANK TOP k] FOR <entity_table>.<primary_key>=<value> [ASSUMING <cond>]
```
- The TARGET decides the task:
  - Aggregation over a time-stamped event table → regression:
    `AGG(<table>.<column> [WHERE ...], <start>, <end>, <time_unit>)` where AGG ∈ COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX.
    The window `(anchor+start, anchor+end]` is relative to the prediction "anchor" time; time_unit ∈
    seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months. Use `*` to count rows: `COUNT(orders.*, 0, 30, days)`.
  - A condition / comparison (`> 0`, `= 0`, `>= 100`, `AND`/`OR`) → binary classification:
    e.g. churn = `COUNT(orders.*, 0, 30, days) = 0`; will-purchase = `COUNT(orders.*, 0, 7, days) > 0`.
  - To predict whether a future event MATCHING A CONDITION occurs, put the condition in a `WHERE` *inside*
    the aggregation, then compare to make it binary. NEVER put a row-level event filter after `FOR EACH`
    (only entity filters go there). Compare a **categorical** column with `=` / `!=` ONLY (never `<`/`>`);
    use `<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=` for **numeric** columns. Examples:
    `COUNT(results.* WHERE results.statusId != 1, 0, 365, days) > 0`  (driver will DNF / not-finish next race)
    `MIN(results.position, 0, 365, days) <= 3`  (finish in the top 3 — numeric position column).
  - A direct categorical/ID column → multi-class; a direct numeric column → regression.
  - `LIST_DISTINCT(<fk_column>, start, end, time_unit) RANK TOP k` → recommendation / link prediction
    (the FK column must be a registered link in the graph).
  - Add `FORECAST n TIMEFRAMES` for multi-step forecasting. FORECAST is **single-entity only** — KumoRFM
    forecasts the time series for exactly ONE entity per query. Name that entity by its PRIMARY KEY with
    `FOR <entity>.<primary_key>=<value>` (never a category, measure, or grouping column). Never frame a
    forecast as "for each" / "per" many entities.
    Choose regression vs FORECAST by the NUMBER OF FUTURE PERIODS asked for, NOT the number of entities:
    - **One future period** ("next month", "next quarter", "over the next N days", an "outlook" / "expected"
      total) → a plain aggregation **regression** `AGG(<event>.<col>, 0, N, <unit>) FOR EACH
      <entity>.<primary_key>` — one expected value per entity for that window. Use this even for a SINGLE
      entity (e.g. "demand for product X next month" → `SUM(product_demand_daily.units, 0, 1, months) FOR
      products.product_id='X'`), and ALWAYS use it when an explanation is wanted.
      NEVER use FORECAST for a single-period question.
    - **Multiple successive periods / a trajectory over time** ("month-by-month", "each of the next 6 months",
      "weekly trend") → `FORECAST n TIMEFRAMES` (single-entity, per the constraint above).
- `FOR EACH <entity>.<pk>` predicts a population. Add `WHERE <entity>.<col> = ...` only for a population
  subset. `FOR <entity>.<pk>=<value>` predicts exactly one entity and MUST be used for a single-entity
  explanation; do not express a single primary key as `FOR EACH ... WHERE <pk> = <value>`.
- Do NOT use `EVALUATE PREDICT ...` — it is unsupported. Emit a plain `PREDICT ...`.

## Common mistakes to avoid (these FAIL validation)
- PQL has NO SQL subqueries. NEVER write `SELECT` anywhere — not in `ASSUMING`, not anywhere else. To reach a
  related table, rely on the graph's foreign keys (the entity→event link is IMPLICIT); to restrict which
  entities are scored, use the SEPARATE entity-selection ```sql block (below), never a subquery inside PREDICT.
- NEVER use SQL time expressions in PQL (`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `NOW()`, `CURRENT_DATE`, `SYSDATE`, …). The
  prediction window is already relative to the data's anchor time via the `(start, end, unit)` args. To scope to
  entities in a future window (e.g. open / at-risk orders), put that date filter in the entity-selection ```sql.
- An aggregation's `WHERE` can ONLY filter columns of the SAME table being aggregated. `COUNT(po_receipts.*
  WHERE po_receipts.status = 'late', …)` is fine; `COUNT(po_receipts.* WHERE purchase_orders.is_critical = ...)`
  is INVALID — you cannot reference another table inside the aggregation. If a needed attribute lives on a
  different table (e.g. is_critical on purchase_orders/components), drop it from the aggregation and filter those
  entities in the entity-selection ```sql block instead, or pick the closest column on the aggregated table.
- `RANK TOP k` is ONLY valid with `LIST_DISTINCT(...)` (link prediction) or a direct multi-categorical column,
  and it goes immediately AFTER the target and BEFORE `FOR EACH` — never after `FOR EACH`. NEVER add RANK to a
  binary (`COUNT(...) > 0` / `= 0`) or numeric-aggregation target. For "most/least likely", emit the binary
  classifier WITHOUT RANK — its probabilities already rank the entities.
- Do NOT predict generic child-event existence/counts for an order-like entity (e.g. `COUNT(order_lines.*) > 0
  FOR EACH sales_orders`, `COUNT(po_receipts.*) FOR EACH purchase_orders`): those relationships are
  near-deterministic and not a useful prediction. Predict an OUTCOME with a status `WHERE` filter (e.g. late /
  slip / short) instead, or answer historical "how many" counts with SQL.
- For recommendation / "which X to recommend / most likely to buy / engage with" questions, use link
  prediction: `LIST_DISTINCT(<event>.<fk>, 0, N, unit) RANK TOP k FOR EACH <entity>.<pk>`, where `<fk>` is a
  registered FK link in the graph (see the verified examples below). RANK TOP goes before FOR EACH.
- Account growth, retention, cross-sell, upsell, and outreach-strategy questions over customer/account
  purchase history are next-best-product recommendations: treat them as the link-prediction case above — rank
  the future product/item FK on the timestamped purchase/order-line event for each customer/account entity,
  when the graph has a customer→product purchase edge (see the verified examples below).
- Spell every identifier exactly as the graph above spells it. Write a name bare when it can be written bare
  (`payments.days_late`); backtick-quote one that cannot, such as a name containing a space — the graph shows
  those already quoted, so copy that form (`people.`Customer ID``). NEVER use double quotes or square brackets.
- `FOR EACH` MUST name the entity by a primary-key column (`FOR EACH customers.customer_id`), never just the
  table. Where the graph marks a table as keyed on several columns TOGETHER (`PRIMARY KEY (`Customer ID`,
  REGION)`), name any ONE of those columns — that identifies the whole key, so do not list them all.
- `FORECAST` is single-entity: forecast ONE entity by its primary key and scope to it with the entity-selection SQL (a single primary-key row). A forecast framed over many entities ("for each" / "per"), or keyed on a non-primary-key column, is wrong.
- Inside an aggregation `WHERE`, qualify the column with its table: `COUNT(payments.* WHERE payments.days_late > 0, 0, 30, days)`.
- Add entity filters ONLY for subset values explicitly named in the user question. Never copy or infer filters
  from verified examples or dataset/domain wording; generic nouns like "business", "customer", "account", or
  "entity" are not filters. If the user asks "which/top/all" entities without a subset value, score the full
  entity population.
- For gain/loss, increase/decrease, or change questions, if the schema exposes an explicit numeric change/delta
  target for the requested metric and horizon, predict that target directly; do not predict the level and
  subtract a baseline in the answer.
- The entity-to-event link is IMPLICIT via the graph's foreign key — NEVER restate the join key inside the
  aggregation. For "orders per APAC customer" write `COUNT(sales_orders.*, 0, 90, days) FOR EACH
  customers.customer_id WHERE customers.region = 'apac'`, NOT
  `COUNT(sales_orders.* WHERE sales_orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id, 0, 90, days)`. Match every
  filter value to what the question actually names and to the column's sampled values (e.g. "key customers"
  is account_tier = 'key', not 'strategic'); never swap in a different tier/region/status than was asked.
- For a slip / late / on-time OUTCOME, classify on the status (or flag) column using its exact values from
  the column table below — e.g. predict order slip with `order_fulfillment.status = 'late'`. (As the
  grammar says, compare a categorical column with `=` / `!=`, never `<` / `>`.)
- For "at risk / will slip / likely in the next N days" questions, scope the entity-selection SQL to
  entities whose due/committed date falls in that future window relative to the latest data — not merely
  `IS NOT NULL`, which ranks stale historical rows."""
