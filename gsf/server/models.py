"""Item models carried inside the response envelopes.

``gsf/server/responses.py`` owns the envelopes (``{"data": ...}``); this
module owns what goes *inside* them, so the generated OpenAPI spec names the
fields a caller actually receives instead of an opaque object.

The shapes mirror what the DAL reads return from
``gsf/dal/`` plus whatever the DAL/service layer adds in Python afterwards.
The DAL returns plain dicts, so the rule here is: a field is
required only when the row is anchored on it (an ``id`` matched by the query,
or a value the Python layer writes unconditionally). Everything else is
optional and nullable — a missing value comes back as ``null``, and a
required-but-null field would turn a documentation change into a 500.

Item shapes are shared across routers on purpose: a Zone chip is rendered by
the zones, terms, sql-attributes and exploration endpoints alike, so it is
modelled once here rather than four times in four router packages.

Every model allows extra keys — see :class:`ApiModel`.

    ``path`` says where the object sits — ``database.schema`` for a Table,
    ``database.schema.table`` for a Column, and the owning Term for either kind
    of attribute, which are properties of one in the same sense and so are
    described the same way. Null only for a Term, which is a glossary entry
    rather than a catalog object and sits under nothing.

    ``tagged_by`` and ``rule`` are where the label came from, for the page's
    "Tagged By" column: the account that applied it by hand, or the rule that
    matched. At most one is set — a label has one source — and both null is an
    answer rather than a gap: it is what an attach carrying no identity records,
    so the page reads it as "Auto Generated", the deployment having labelled
    this itself. A row written before either column existed reads the same way,
    since a label nobody claimed is a label nobody claimed.

    ``tagged_by`` is an opaque Better Auth user id, resolved to a name by the
    gateway for the reason :class:`Tag`'s authors are: the accounts live in a
    schema this service does not own. An id that resolves to nothing reads as
    "Auto Generated" as well — these are not foreign keys, so an account can be
    deleted and leave the label behind, and the column names a person or a rule

    ``synonyms`` defaults on for the reason it does there — it is what the

    objects is answered with the tags as they are rather than as it sent them.
    See ``RuleTagRef`` in ``gsf/server/rules/router.py``. The ids are checked
