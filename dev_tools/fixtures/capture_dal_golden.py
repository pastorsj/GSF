"""Snapshot every DAL read against the graph fixture, for the Postgres port.

The refactor replaces ~5,000 lines of SQL with SQL while keeping every
``gsf.dal`` signature identical. Greenfield cutover means there is no production
data to diff against, so these captures are the **only** fidelity oracle: Phases
5-10 are graded by replaying them against the Postgres implementation and
requiring identical output.

**Ids are normalised.** Node ids are ``randomUUID()``, so a raw capture would
differ on every run and compare equal to nothing. Each id is replaced by a
stable token derived from what the node *is* — ``<table:pagila.public.film>``,
``<term:Film>`` — which also makes a failing diff readable, and means the
Postgres implementation is free to generate different uuids as long as the
graph shape matches.

Usage::

    uv run --no-sync python -m dev_tools.fixtures.seed_graph_fixture --reset
    uv run --no-sync python -m dev_tools.fixtures.capture_dal_golden
