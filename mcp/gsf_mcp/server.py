INSTRUCTIONS = """\
GSF (Generative Semantic Fabric) answers questions about an organisation's
structured data. It holds a compiled semantic layer — a glossary of business
terms mapped onto real database columns and reviewed SQL expressions — over the
databases this deployment is connected to.

Use `ask_question` for anything that needs an actual answer from the data. It
runs a full text-to-SQL agent and returns the answer, the SQL it ran, and the
rows.

The other tools exist so you can understand the vocabulary before you ask, and
check your assumptions after. A productive sequence is usually:

1. `search_terms` to find out what a business word means here. Deployments
   differ: "active customer" is a defined term with specific SQL behind it,
   not something to guess at.
2. `check_answerable` if you are unsure the question is in scope. It is far
   cheaper than `ask_question` and tells you whether the semantic layer covers
   the entities involved.
3. `ask_question` to get the answer.

`check_readiness` answers a different question: whether this deployment can
answer anything at all. A deployment with no database connection reads normally
and still fails every question, so reach for it before a first question here, or
when `ask_question` comes back empty — an empty answer is far more often a
deployment that is not set up than a question that was misunderstood.

Work through the semantic layer, not around it. `get_term_columns` tells you
which physical columns a term stands for, `get_term_sql_attributes` and
`get_sql_attribute` give you expressions that were already reviewed here, and
`describe_table` says what a table means rather than only its shape. There is
deliberately no tool for browsing databases, schemas, or raw columns:
questions are answered against the glossary.

Every tool reads. Nothing here modifies the catalog, the glossary, or the
underlying databases.
