"""``ask_question`` — the text-to-SQL agent as a single MCP tool.

Hand-written rather than generated, because ``POST /api/chat/completions``
answers with ``text/event-stream``: the agent emits a step event per graph node
and only then a result. ``FastMCP.from_openapi`` produces request/response
tools and has nothing useful to say about a stream.

Streaming is not merely an obstacle here. A run is many sequential model calls
and routinely takes tens of seconds, which is long enough that a silent tool
looks hung, so the step events are forwarded as MCP progress notifications and
the caller sees the same reasoning trace the web UI shows.

The response the UI receives is markdown with fenced SQL, shaped for a renderer.
This returns the parts separately instead, so a calling agent can use the SQL
and the rows without parsing prose.
