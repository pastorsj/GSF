"""Settings for the GSF MCP server, read from the environment.

The server talks to the **public** GSF API, not to the Python services behind
it: those are ClusterIP-only and reachable solely through the Next.js proxy,
which is where authentication and permission checks live. So all it needs is the
base URL of a GSF deployment.

It holds no credential of its own, and there is no setting that would give it
one. Callers sign in against GSF itself — the same login page and the same SSO
behind it that they would meet in a browser — and every call then runs as the
person who signed in, with exactly their permissions. Nothing to mint, paste, or
share, and no way to configure a single identity that everybody silently
inherits.

That leaves ``GSF_API_URL`` as the only setting most deployments touch. Pointing
at a laptop's stack or at a production instance differs only in that value.
